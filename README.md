## 1. Introduction

This repository contains the materials for TP2, which is an integral part of our Machine Learning course. The goal of TP2 is to implement and evaluate regression models on a selected dataset.

## 2. Assignment Overview

This TP2 assignment comprises the following key components:

### 2.1 Assignment Timeline

- TP2 starts after the completion of Chapter 7 in the course.
- You have the entire session of the 6th lecture to work on the practical assignment.
- Submission is expected at the end of the 7th lecture, specifically by October 19th.

### 2.2 Evaluation

- TP2 is worth 100 points, which accounts for 10% of the final course grade.
- These points are split equally between the code and the report, with 50 points for each.

## 3. Prerequisites

To successfully complete this assignment, you should have a basic understanding of Python and machine learning concepts.

## 4. Getting Started

- Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
- Set up your Python environment with the required packages and libraries.

## 5. Data Selection

For this assignment, your first task is to select a dataset. You are encouraged to choose a dataset from the following sources:

- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

It is recommended to select a dataset focused on regression problems, which involves estimating the values of a target variable.

## 6. Data Preprocessing

Once you have selected a dataset, the next steps involve data preprocessing:

- Managing missing values.
- Handling categorical variables, if applicable.

## 7. Model Building

You will then set up a pipeline for training and testing regression models based on various strategies.

## 8. Performance Evaluation

You will implement various tools such as performance indicators and visualizations to evaluate the regression models.

## 9. Model Comparison

The assignment culminates in a comparative analysis of different linear regression algorithms.

## 10. Conclusion

The final section of your report should summarize what you have learned, what you appreciated, and what challenges you encountered during the assignment.

## 11. Report Submission

- Your report should not exceed 10 pages.
- Include the names and permanent codes of all team members on the first page.
- Ensure that your report is well-structured, including a dataset description, data preprocessing steps, a pipeline diagram, analysis of regression results, and model comparisons.
- Your report will be primarily assessed based on the relevance of the information and illustrations, as well as the quality of written French.

We wish you the best of luck with your TP2 assignment. Please submit your report to Moodle under "Rendus du TP2" by the deadline. Be mindful of the penalty for late submissions, which incurs a 10% reduction per day after the deadline of the 7th lecture.
